## Getting Started

1. Download your image file from [releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/images/releases).
2. Flash your image to an SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
3. Insert your SD card and connect your device with power and ethernet.
4. Navigate to [`https://evcc.local/`](https://evcc.local/) in your browser. Accept the self-signed certificate.
5. You should see the evcc web interface.
6. Alternatively: Use the [evcc iOS/Android app](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/features/app) to connect to your evcc instance.

For more detailed instructions, see the [full documentation](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/installation/linux-image).

## Available Services

| Service    | Port | Protocol | URL                                 | Note                           |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| evcc UI    | 443  | HTTPS    | `https://evcc.local/`               | self-signed cert **(default)** |
|            | 7070 | HTTP     | `http://evcc.local:7070/`           | unencrypted                    |
| OCPP       | 8888 | WSS      | `wss://evcc.local:8888/<stationid>` | self-signed cert               |
|            | 8887 | WS       | `ws://evcc.local:8887/<stationid>`  | unencrypted **(default)**      |
| Cockpit UI | 9090 | HTTPS    | `https://evcc.local:9090/`          | self-signed cert               |

The image offers an encrypted version for all services. We recommend using encrypted connections even in local networks. For OCPP, some EV chargers don't support self-signed certificates. Use unencrypted WS as a fallback.

## Administration

### Cockpit UI

Login to the Cockpit web console on [`https://evcc.local:9090/`](https://evcc.local:9090/)

- username `admin`
- password `admin`

You'll be prompted to change your password. **Remember the new password.** There is no reset.

You can see system health, update packages and run terminal commands.

Alternatively: connect via SSH `ssh admin@evcc.local`

### Updating evcc

Login to Cockpit ([`https://evcc.local:9090/`](https://evcc.local:9090/)) and click on **Software updates** in the left navigation.
Update evcc (and other packages) as needed.

### Nightly Builds

The image uses the stable evcc version by default.
To switch to nightly builds, login to Cockpit ([`https://evcc.local:9090/`](https://evcc.local:9090/)), click on **Terminal** in the left navigation, and run these commands:

```bash
# Add the nightly repository
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/unstable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash

# Update and upgrade to nightly
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

To switch back to stable:

```bash
# Remove nightly repository
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/evcc-unstable.list

# Reinstall stable version
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall evcc
```

For more details, see the [Linux installation documentation](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/installation/linux).

### Installing to Internal eMMC

For boards with internal eMMC storage (like NanoPi R3S), you can migrate your system from SD card to eMMC for better performance and reliability.

1. Flash and boot from SD card ([see Getting Started](#getting-started))
2. Login to [Cockpit](#cockpit-ui) and click on **Terminal** in the left navigation
3. Run the command `armbian-install`
4. Enter your password when prompted
5. Select **"Boot from eMMC"** and follow the steps
6. Select **ext4** file system when asked
7. The system will copy everything from SD card to internal eMMC
8. After completion, power off the device, eject the SD card, and reboot
9. The system will now boot from eMMC

For more details, see the [Armbian Getting Started Guide](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#installation).

## Hardware Recommendations

### Storage

16GB storage should be enough when only using evcc.
We recommend running your system from eMMC instead of SD card.
**NanoPi boards come with built-in eMMC storage.**
If you decide to run your system directly from SD card, be sure to read [Armbian's recommendations](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#armbian-getting-started-guide) first.

### CPU and RAM

All above boards have plenty of CPU and RAM for evcc.
1GB RAM should be enough.
Pick 2GB if you want to be on the safe side.

## Network Recommendations

For reliability we **strongly suggest** using a **wired ethernet connection**.

### Wireless Setup

If a wired setup is not possible this image also includes a wireless onboarding process.
The device will create a WiFi setup hotspot **if no internet connection is detected after 30 seconds of boot**.

1. Power your device
2. Connect to `evcc-setup` network from your phone or laptop
3. Select your WiFi network and enter the password
4. Connect back to your home network
5. Continue with step 4 from [Getting Started](#getting-started)

**Note**: WiFi setup is a one-time process. To reconfigure WiFi at a new location, simply reboot the device and `evcc-setup` will appear again.

For ethernet-only boards like the NanoPi, you can use WiFi USB dongles. The following adapters have been tested successfully:

- EDUP EP-B8508GS
- _add your's here ..._

## Hardware Comparison

CPU performance is not critical for evcc operation as it's not CPU-intensive. These benchmarks are provided for reference and future-proofing considerations.

Benchmark methodology: Results obtained using sysbench with the following commands:

```bash
# CPU Single
sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --threads=1 --time=200 run
# CPU Multi
sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --threads=4 --time=200 run
```

## Building Images Locally

### Requirements

- **macOS:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- **Linux (x86_64):** Docker Engine with QEMU binfmt support for cross-architecture builds. See the [Armbian Build Preparation Guide](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Preparation/) for details.
